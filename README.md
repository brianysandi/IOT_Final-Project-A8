## Introduction to the problem and the solution
<p align="justify">In the rapidly evolving landscape of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, voice interaction has emerged as a compelling interface for user engagement. The integration of Speech-to-Text (STT) technology into IoT projects allows for natural and intuitive communication between users and connected devices. </p>

## Hardware design and implementation details
<p align="justify">To design a speech-to-text system using an ESP32, an INMP441 microphone, and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, first we have to do soldering job to assemble the INMP441 pins
. After the soldering job to integrate the INMP441 module with its pin, we have to check our soldering job so that it can do its function properly. We used a multimeter to test whether the module and its pins can conduct electricity with no flaw. Next, we connect the jumper cables to the corresponding pins on the ESP32.
